**Final Score: 57/60**

The grading rubric for the final can be found in GitHub: https://github.com/paulboal/hds5210-2023/blob/main/final/final-instructions.pdf

**Functional Requirements**
* 5 points - Uses data from at least two different sources: local file, internet, web service, relational database, AWS S3, etc; and formats: CSV, JSON, database, XML, Excel, etc
* 5 points - Data from multiple sources has to be joined together at least twice
* 5 points - Data is aggregated or pivoted at least twice during the program
* 5 points - Some kind of field-level transformation is performed at least 5 times
* 5 points - The program creates 3 or more data visualizations 
* 5 points - The program serves a theoretical purpose described in documentation, that could potentially do something in healthcare or another industry of interest

**Modularity / Style**
* 15 points - The code is broken up into various functions or classes to make testing and reuse easier

**Documentation and Professionalism**
* 15 points - All functions are documented and notebook cells include annotations and explanations.

**(-1) Merging (joining) on a columns that aren't unique ends up applything the rows from one side of the joint to multiple rows on the other side.  It ends up duplicating rows.**

**(-2) I didn't see much in the way of field-level transformations that added any value to the analysis.  Five were required.**

**Overall, I think you did a great job on this project. Love the data selection, but I would have tried to bring in another dataset to augment/extend these, too.**
