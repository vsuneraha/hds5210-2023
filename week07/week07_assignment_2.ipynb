In this week's assignment, you will need to create your own JSON document to store information about yourself and the grades you've received from week 1 to week 4 and the week 6 quiz.  That is, everything you should have received a grade for.  Then you'll need to show me you know how to navigate the JSON in that file.\n",

This part is easy to work with and straightforward to access in Python. The second part, 'assignment,' is a list of assignments, each with an assignment name, a grade (a numerical score), and a description of the most challenging aspect. The code uses Python's 'json' module to load this JSON data and then pulls out the information we need. It's relatively simple to understand and manage, which makes it a great example for anyone learning about working with structured data in Python.
