# Week 9 Feedback
Each week, you'll receive a feedback file in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.

This assignment was focused on the use of Python and Pandas to load and visualize data, giving you something to interpret and help you understand the data. You did not nee to encapsulate your code in functions or provide docstrings/doctests in your functions.

## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
