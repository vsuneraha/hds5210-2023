# Week 4 Feedback
Like your weekly assignments, your feedback on this quiz is provided as `quiz_feedback.md` in GitHub showing a final grade and any specific comments on your assignment, including why points (if any) were deducted.

A big reason for doing this quiz during class was to see what you are able to do one your own without talking to other students. I gave clear instructions that you were NOT to collaborate with others and that the work you submit was to be your own.  If you used ChatGPT or another resource and clearly copied and pasted that work, you will lose all of the points for the first part of this quiz.

## Final Score: 10/20

## Functionality: 
_Did your code do what the assignment required?_
* All code worked as expected

## Fill in the blank:
_Did you answer the data type questions correctly?_
* All data types questions were answered correctly

## Coding Best Practices:
_Was your code readable, efficient, and in line with what we learned in class?_
* Good variable names?
* Code written into functions where appropriate?
* Appropriate comments with your code?
* Generally easy to follow and undersand?
# Quality and Completeness

The code provided by ChatGPT and consequently the code you submitted for this quiz did not include all of the required documentation and docstring tests:
* **(-10 from base) You did not have any docstrings**

> For full credit, your code must satisfy all of the following requirements:
> 1. Pass all of the assert tests provided below
> 2. Have a docstring with parameter types, function description, and at least 5 test cases that cover a range of inputs and outputs
> 3. Successfully run all 5 tests when the *run_docstring_examples* cell is called
> 4. Implement the rules above completely, even if a test scenario is not represented in the asserts or docstrings
